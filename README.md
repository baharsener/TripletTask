# TripletTask
A task exploring the relationship between the mental timeline and spatiotemporal memory
A triplet of objects is presented in either a left-to-right linear, right-to-left linear or a nonlinear order (this is determined by where on the screen the first, second and third images appear).
After 25 encoding trials, participants are shown these objects one by one and asked the temporal order of the object ("when did you see this object, first, second or third?")
Each triplet is shown twice with a mask in between, and about 20% of the trials show a different order during these two viewing portions to act as an attention checker ("were the two triplets same or different?")
We have a 2 second fixation cross to base a baseline pupil dilation off of
we have a delay between retrieval question and appearance of answer options to check for eye movements
We think that pupil dilation will track with memory accuracy.
